# Typology, network features and damage response in worldwide urban road systems: Supporting Information
This repository contains supporting datasets for the paper "Typology, network features and damage response in worldwide urban road systems" by Valenzuela, Legara &amp; Monterola, submitted to PLOS ONE.

## City Polygons

`city-polygons` contain the polygonal boundaries for used to extract 2014 and 2019 city map data from corresponding `planet.osm` files (old, year-specific versions of which are hosted on planet.osm.org), using a tool such as `osmium`.

## City Datasets

`city-datasets` contain city road network properties, as well as result variables from the damage simulations (details in the paper).
